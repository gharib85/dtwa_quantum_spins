In the params and dtwa classes:
1. Remove the file output code as well as the filenames from params. Let the user do it
2. Let the final output be a matrix of spins instead of observables. Let the user calculate what he wants and distribute the memory via multiple MPI communicators.
3. Wrangle open systems into the code
4. Find a way for the user to put in his own sampling schemes, defaulting to the ones already in code.
