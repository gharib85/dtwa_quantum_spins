In the params and dtwa classes:
1. Remove the file output code as well as the filenames from params. Let the user do it.
2. Let the final output be a matrix of spins at end time AND observables. Let the user calculate what he wants and distribute the memory via multiple MPI communicators.
3. Wrangle open systems into the code
4. Incorporate Lorenzo's code for the BBGKY function using Cython. His code is faster and better optimized.
